ZORRO : A probabilistic alignment masking program

Authors: Martin Wu, Sourav Chatterji and Jonathan Eisen

1. Prerequisites 

ZORRO needs the C compiler gcc (preferably version 4.1.2 or later). In addition, it needs FastTree which can be downloaded from:

http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/

2. Installation

On the command line, type "make clean" aand then "make". The binary "probmask" should be produced. 

Optional : To easily access ZORRO from the command line, add the directory containing ZORRO to your environment variable $PATH. 

3. Input/Output Formats

ZORRO is run as: "probmask [options] inputfile > outputfile"

Input : Here the input file is multiple sequence alignment in multi fasta format. More details about this format can be found at:

http://baboon.math.berkeley.edu/mavid/multifasta.html

An example input file is provided in : Example/family_15833_5_prank2_2_cDNAid

Output : The output is a plain text file with confidence scores of each column in each line. The confidence score, which is a measure of the reliability of a column according to a pair-HMM model is a floating point between 0 and 10. The 

An example output fle is provided in : Example/family_15833_5_prank2_2_cDNAid.mask

4. Options

ZORRO has several options which are listed below and can also be accessed by typing "probmask -h".

-sample          : Sampling pairs to calculate alignment reliabilty [Off By Default]
-nosample        : No Sampling i.e. using every pair to calculate alignment reliabilty [On By Default]
-noweighting     : Using sum of pairs instead of weighted sum of pairs to calculate column confidence [Off By Default]
-ignoregaps      : Ignore pair-gaps in columns when calculating column confidences [Off By Default]
-Nsample NUMBER  : Tells ZORRO to sample #NUMBER pairs when sampling, automatically turns on -sample option [Samples 10*Nseq sequences By Default]
-treeprog PROGRAM: Tells ZORRO to use PROGRAM instead of the default FastTree to create guide tree [FastTree By Default]
-guide treefile  : User provided guide tree
